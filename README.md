## A  small project utilizing  C# to get more  familiar with objects and classes

### This project is a simple turn based rpg.
- As of now, all weapons and armour are unlocked at the beginning.
- No story is implemented yet, just some basic combat, gear selection, and stat checking.
- The enemy encounters are random, and no bosses are set in place yet.

### For the future I would like to add:
- A feature which lets enemies drop gold which will be used to unlock the weapons and armour.
- An actual story to make the game more engaging.
- A better way to encounter enemies and a final boss
- Ways to increase stats without needing gear
- Quests to get gold or gear
- A way to travel to different locations in game
- Possible XP system to level up your character and increase stats
